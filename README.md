# School District Analysis
Analyzing test score data for a school district

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to assess the impact that a school's size, type (district vs charter), and funding (on a per student basis) has on student academic performance (specifically in Math & Reading test scores). 


## Results
#### Note: Due to the evidence of academic dishonesty that was identified at Thomas High School ("THS"), the Math and Reading scores for the entire ninth grade class at THS has been nullified. The impact to the analysis is summarized below:
1. The district summary is negatively impacted by the removal of THS 9th grade test scores. We can see the Average Math Score decreasing slightly and the % of students passing math, reading, and overall, each experience a decrease.
Includes THS 9th Graders:

4. THS performance
    - Math & Reading Scores by grade
      - no change just missing 9g for ths
    - Scores by school spending
      - 630-644 range avg math score and %s dropped. avg reading score actually increased - overall immaterial due to rounding
    - Scores by school size
      - same for med 1000 - 2000 range
    - Scores by school type
      - same for charter

## Summary
The removal of THS grade 9 test scores resulted in the following changes to the overall analysis:
1.
